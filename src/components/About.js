        Throughout the past 11 years, I've journeyed my way through the
        evolution of web and mobile technologies. I've built plenty of websites
        &amp; applications, eventually realizing that what I really loved doing,
        was creating designs that <em>look cool </em>ðŸ˜Ž.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, I believe that form <strong>follows</strong> function.
        Good functionality is the key to problem-solving; good design elevates
        it. Like the conspicuousness of{' '}

        , I find myself constantly noticing problems and coming up with ways on
        how to improve them. Problems are brain-teasers to me: if I apply enough
        thought and research, a solution will present itself.

        The products I've worked on have all been unique, so they've had
        different constraints, problems, and solutions; what I have found to be
        constant though, is the willingness of peers (and of users) to help me
        design. Whenever I find myself in a rut, the people I work with have
        alwaysÂ shared their insights and knowledge to help out. I would not be
        where I am without the guidance of my past co-workers, mentors, and
        managers.
