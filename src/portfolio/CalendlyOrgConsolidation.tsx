            <h2>The challenge</h2>

            <h3>Enterprise consolidation pain points</h3>

            <p>Corporate M&A activity and decentralized software adoption created a critical operational problem: enterprise customers had multiple fragmented Calendly organizations across departments, business units, and acquired companies.</p>

            <p>Customer Success teams spent 10+ hours per consolidation, manually migrating accounts, and enterprise admins lacked visibility into the process. This created security vulnerabilities, billing inefficiencies, and frustrated customers during critical business transitions.</p>

            <h3>Business impact</h3>
            <p>The manual process was unsustainable as Calendly moved upmarket:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>CSM bandwidth:</strong> dozens of consolidation requests annually, each requiring weeks of coordination</li>
              <li><strong>Customer risk:</strong> Delayed migrations during M&A integration timelines</li>
              <li><strong>Security gaps:</strong> Temporary dual-access periods increased compliance risks</li>
            </ul>

            {/* <h3>Setting the goals</h3>
            <p>We aimed to bring two key changes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Automate the migration process, reducing the CSM team's time spent on each migration</li>
              <li>Enhance the customer experience by offering more visibility, updates, and control over the migration process</li>
            </ul> */}

            <h2>The process</h2>

            <h3>Service design approach</h3>
            <p>I mapped the end-to-end consolidation journey across three user types: Customer Success Managers, enterprise admins, and end users. This service blueprint revealed critical handoff points where automation could reduce manual touchpoints while maintaining admin control.</p>

            </figure>

            <h3>Cross-application user flows</h3>
            <p>The consolidation process required seamless coordination between internal CSM tools and customer-facing admin dashboards. I designed connected experiences that kept all stakeholders informed while maintaining security protocols throughout the migration.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>

            <p>The automated consolidation tool transformed enterprise account management:</p>

            <h2>Reflections</h2>

            <h3>What worked</h3>
            <p>Regular collaboration with Customer Success teams provided continuous validation of design decisions. Their frontline experience with customer pain points ensured the solution addressed real operational needs rather than theoretical improvements.</p>

            <h3>Opportunities</h3>
            <p>Creating a comprehensive service blueprint earlier would have revealed cross-application dependencies sooner, potentially reducing development complexity. For future multi-stakeholder tools, I'd prioritize service design documentation to align technical and business requirements upfront.</p>
