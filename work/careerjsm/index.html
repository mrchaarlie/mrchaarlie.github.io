        <h2 class="work-details__summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>I designed a web application to help job seekers track and manage their job search. Through user interviews,
          design sprints, and iterative deployments, I helped build and pivot the product into a platform that helps
          train and coach any person to find a job in today's market. It's now being used in 8 countries, with over 6000
          active users.</p>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h2 class="work-details__title">Background</h2>
        <p>
          Job-seekers have a lot to worry about. Sometimes, they've been out of the job hunt for a while and need to
          refresh their skills to compete. While there are several resources online, most of them were separate one-off
          tools that don't account for a user's technical literacy, nor their emotional state-of-being. If they've just
          lost a job, they can be in a sensitive emotional state so it's important to be empathetic and nurturing
          through their difficult time.
        </p>

        <p>
          CareerJSM sought to help these people out, and I was in charge of the design of the app. We partnered with
          outplacement agencies to learn and maximize the results and effectiveness of our services.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="work-image-container">
        <div class="work-images">
          <img src="../../img/work/careerjsm-cover.png" class="work-image" alt="" aria-hidden="true">
        </div>
        <div class="work-image__caption">The Resume Builder I designed had various templates to offer the user some
          customization.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h2 class="work-details__title">Measuring success</h2>
        <p>We were designing an app with a suite of tools and resources, that needed to fulfill a set of requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>users with low technical literacy should be able to the app easily.</li>
          <li>users need to be able to manage their job search, with the tools provided offering comparable or better
            value than competitors.</li>
          <li>branding and copy needed to consider the users potential emotional and mental state.</li>
          <li>increase user satisfaction, engagement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To address our user's needs, I conducted user interviews and surveys to find pain points and areas of
          improvement. In one case, I discovered that many users have difficulty building authentic relationships with
          people (i.e.: not a transactional relationship), which was not something the team had considered. After seeing
          the potential value of this need, I facilitated a team design sprint to address these issues and created a
          networking dashboard.</p>
      </div>

        <div class="work-images">
          <img src="../../img/work/careerjsm-networking.png" class="work-image" alt="" aria-hidden="true">
        </div>
        <div class="work-image__caption">A blank networking dashboard that a user might see.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h2 class="work-details__title">Designs</h2>
        <p>The start of any new process is registration and onboarding. While working with outplacement agencies, I
          created a registration user flow that would work cohesively with consultants. I used thoughtful copy, layout,
          and animation effects, to ease the user into the product with as little friction as possible. The resulting
          update increased user sign-up by close to 100%.
        </p>
        <div class="work-image-container">
          <div class="work-images">
            <img src="../../img/work/careerjsm-signup.png" class="work-image" alt="" aria-hidden="true">
          </div>
          <div class="work-image__caption">One of the iterations created while designing the signup interfaces.</div>
        </div>
        <p>One of the other main features I worked on was the job tracker page. I designed it as a kanban board to
          provide
          the users with a visual sense of progress as they progress in their job search. Over several iterations, I
          updated the copy, layout, and structure of the tool to optimize usability for users with low tech-literacy.
        </p>

          <div class="work-image__caption">The Job Tracker page: applications are represented by cards, which you can
            drag to the right as you progress through the application process.</div>
        </div>
        <p>To ensure a smooth and bug-free app, I wrote and ran integration tests to ensure features were continuously
          working. I also manually audited the app for responsive design, web accessibility (WCAG 2.0), and localization
          compatibility.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h2 class="work-details__title">Development</h2>
        <p>I worked on the development of the site using HTML, CSS, EmberJS, with a PostgreSQL backend. Most design
          tools used were Illustrator, Photoshop, with some After Effects.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h2 class="work-details__title">Results</h2>
        <p>I made sure to record, gather, and analyze data to set target KPIs as we were building out the new features.
          Some things I looked for were user satisfaction, ease-of-use, and overall value. I combined qualitative
          in-person testing with quantitative survey feedback to gather as much data as possible. After analyzing the
          data, I presented my findings to the product team and made recommendations on how to proceed. This was an
          iterative cycle that I conducted every few months.</p>
        <p>Throughout my time on this project, I helped increase sign-up rates, user-satisfaction, and set the standard
          for accessibility and mobile responsiveness.</p>
