        <h2 class="work-details__summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>I designed an automated news feed, designed for TV mediums in corporate environments. I optimized content for
          readability and accessibility by conducting research and incorporating user feedback. I also designed an
          interactive version for individual usage on mobile/web devices.</p>
      </div>

      <hr>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h2 class="work-details__title">Background</h2>
        <p>
          DIVE Networks is a digital media company that displays a stream of real-time news content for companies, in
          order to surface relevant and insightful information. This feed was informed by trends, social posts, and
          news. I oversaw feature designs and widget creation from conception to delivery, ensuring that the content was
          accessible and delivered in a visually aesthetic way.
        </p>

        <div class="work-image-container">
          <div class="work-images">
            <img src="../../img/work/dive-responsive.png" class="work-image" alt="" aria-hidden="true">
          </div>
          <div class="work-image__caption">DIVE was responsive and compatible on various devices.</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h2 class="work-details__title">Measuring success</h2>
        <p>
          In order for our customers to find value in this product, we needed to address the user needs, but several
          companies had two main audiences: internal employees, and external clients. Employees got more value in seeing
          industry insights and company news, whereas clients got value from seeing industry news and company insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our newsfeed was a playlist of *widgets* that would display sequentially, and depending on the audience,
          different widgets would be shown. I designed each widget with this in mind, understanding that different
          audiences had different expectations and context. However, all designs needed to be
          <strong>accessible</strong> and <strong>visually appealing</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be accessible, content needed to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>be large enough to be seen from across the room (10 feet or more),</li>
          <li>fit on various monitors of varying resolutions,</li>
          <li>have enough contrast do be seen, compensating for poorly calibrated displays,</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To be visually appealing, content needed to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>attract the eye, but not distract the viewer</li>
          <li>blend in cohesively with company branding</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Addressing these issues involved research, testing, design exploration on my part, and ultimately resulted in
          what you can see below.
        </p>

        <p>DIVE’s product space is quite unique as it was a mainly visual and non-interactive consumable product. I had
          to conduct research and refer to industry standards when designing each of the interfaces in the news feed.
          Sizing, color contrast, timing, and speed, were all taken into consideration when creating new widgets. Custom
          animation and layouts were also used to increase visual interest, and to help users quickly differentiate
          between topics.</p>
        <p>DIVE also had a sibling product called Team DIVE, which created to allow users to have an interactive
          experience instead of a purely visual one. It was a responsive web app that not only included the news feed
          mentioned above but also had the added functionality of allowing users to individually select and explore
          brand information available to them. I designed and helped build this project which involved: defining the
          project requirements and needs analysis; designing the information architecture; creating wireframes &
          prototypes; and building the front-end app.</p>
      </div>

        <h2 class="work-details__title">In the market</h2>
        <p>The Dive Networks news feed brings in a lot of value for various company employees and their clients, and has
          been used in places like Sid Lee, Initiative, Dentsu Bos, and AOL.</p>
