        <h2 class="work-details__summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>I redesigned and built a website for an educational platform, increasing SEO, accessibility, and conversion
          rates. This was a long-term project where I collaborated with other designers, directors, and marketers. I
          learned a lot about web strategy, site optimization, how to build scalable sites, and as well as many SEO
          methods. The resulting product had major performance and usability improvements, which generated leads and
          conversions.</p>

        <h2 class="work-details__title">Background</h2>
        <p>
          Female Funders is an educational platform that empowers females to get into angel investing. After <a
            href="https://betakit.com/highline-beta-relaunches-female-funders-angel-investing-program-with-naco/"
            target="_blank">undergoing a relaunch</a> in the Spring of 2018, the program has rapidly evolved, changing
          education material, networking events, and marketing strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result of the changing needs, I worked closely with the program director to help shape and redesign the
          site, with the goal of improving the company brand and site performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          We conducted research on our target audience and discovered potential customers were abandoning the site
          because they were feeling inadequate. Something as abstract as a user's feelings was hard to quantify, but it
          was important to address; we wanted the site to be more warm and welcoming.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h2 class="work-details__title">Measuring success</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Improve the site branding.</strong> The related quantifiable metrics were:
            <ul>
              <li>Increase <em>Time on Page</em> by 50%. The existing average was less than 30 seconds.</li>
              <li>Decrease bounce rates by 50%. There was an overwhelming amount of information, which made it difficult
                to
                understand what we were offering, and what the next steps were.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Increase SEO ratings.</strong> The site lacked certain meta tags, settings, and social media
            integrations.</li>
          <li><strong>Increase site speed.</strong> Image-heavy assets and non-optimized media assets slowed the site.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Make the site accessible and mobile-responsive.</strong> While the site could work on mobile and
            met
            most WCAG 2.0 (A) requirements, there were still improvements to be made, especially with buttons and form
            design.</li>
          <li><strong>Empower users to make informed decisions.</strong> One large page of text and data was
            intimidating and
            made it difficult to track user flow since there was only one page. By splitting the content, and offering
            multiple chances to Learn More, we could gather more metrics.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h3 class="work-details__subtitle">Visual identity</h3>
        <p>
          The key theme centered around empowering women, and there was a lot of effort put into finding the right
          imagery to set the tone to help visitors resonate with the site before reading a single word. I explored
          various themes and moods but ended up deciding to go with imagery that featured our target demographic. I
          added color treatment and photo-editing to compliment the rest of the site's colors.
        </p>

        <p>
          The site's colors were also chosen with care: while the teal hue was associated with the original branding,
          it caused a few problems with accessibility due to how light it was. As a solution, the color value was
          adjusted slightly and subtle text-shadows were added to emphasize the contrast. We also wanted to
          de-emphasize the blue, since it's traditionally known for being cold, despite it being one of the most
          popular brand colors. The teal was feminine and helped set a more calming mood.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h3 class="work-details__subtitle">Site structure</h3>
        <p>
          The course, Angel Academy, was now the focus of the site, but the program's features were diluted by having
          competing information on the home page. I separated the content into sub-pages in order to have a more
          streamlined funnel of content. The initial goal was to get visitors to learn more about Angel Academy, not
          increase the raw number of sign-ups. This seems counter-intuitive at first since content became more difficult
          to access, but we actually found that we generated higher quality leads with a higher rate of application
          approval!
        </p>

        <p>
          On each page under the Angel Academy section, the content was straight to the point and was followed up with 2
          CTA's: <em>Apply</em> or <em>Learn More.</em> This was designed as a nudge, a filter, and as a data collection
          point. Being
          able to see where drop-offs occurred allows us to correct and optimize the issues.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="work-image-container">
        <div class="work-images">
          <img src="../../img/work/ff-sitemap.png" class="work-image" alt="" aria-hidden="true">
        </div>
        <div class="work-image__caption">The new sitemap had more pages due to the distribution of content.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h3 class="work-details__subtitle">Form optimization</h3>
        <p>
          For newsletter sign-ups, having fewer form inputs directly correlates to a higher completion rate, so at one
          point, I reduced the field inputs to only the email in order to increase the subscription count. However, like
          the previous section, it was more important to generate quality leads. We were receiving interest from people
          internationally, but our program only ran in the Americas, and we want to focus on this geographic area first.
          I eventually split up the form to the inputs below. This is definitely not the ideal case for all forms, but
          in our specific situation, it works.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="work-image-container">
        <div class="work-images">
          <img src="../../img/work/ff-newsletter.png" class="work-image" alt="" aria-hidden="true">
        </div>
        <div class="work-image__caption">The Female Funders newsletter subscription form had—<em>gasp</em>—5 input
          fields.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h2 class="work-details__title">Development</h2>
        <p>
          I built most of the site by myself on React, with Contentful as a CMS tool for the copy and blog updates,
          combined with Netlify for deployment, and Zapier for workflow automation.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also used Cypress for integration testing, which was especially useful for testing the Angel Academy *Learn
          More* funnel, and regression testing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="work-details">
        <h2 class="work-details__title">Results & reflections</h2>
        <p>
          Overall the designs underwent several iterations since we follow a lean and agile methodology at Highline
          Beta, but each iteration provided opportunities to learn and improve. By making well-informed hypotheses and
          adjusting based on the new data, the site update was a relative success.
        </p>

        <p>
          Compared with the previous website design, the user's <em>Time on Page</em> went up by 80%, and the <em>Bounce
            Rate</em> decreased by 30%. Several other factors impact this data, such as traffic sources and
          press-releases, but it is a good start towards building better a website in this specific industry.
